<h1>Project 2. Financial Forecasting - Hotel Resort Sales</h1>

What are the key reason to forecast?

1.	Strategic Planning: It helps in setting realistic goals, identifying growth opportunities, and developing long-term strategies to achieve business objectives.
   
3.	Financial Management: Forecasting aids in assessing future revenue, expenses, and profitability, enabling better cash flow and resource allocation.
   
5.	Investment Decisions: It provides valuable insights for stakeholders and potential investors, highlighting the businessâ€™s future earning potential and financial health.

<h1>Project 3. Financial Scenario & Sensitivity Analysis</h1>

1. Calculated the units we need to sell at the price to get to a $100k profit with 2 constraints, below a certain max price and unit volumes - using Solver.

2. Created a Sensitivity Analysis to stress test the profit at different unit prices points and volumes soled - using What If Analysis.

3. Conducted a Scenario Analysis - how are revenue and profit effected in different assumptions and scenarios.


The top three reasons for using sensitivity and scenario analysis in determining profit are:

Risk Management: These analyses help businesses identify and evaluate the impact of key variables (e.g., sales, costs, market conditions) on profitability, enabling preparation for adverse outcomes.

Strategic Decision-Making: They provide insights into the range of possible financial outcomes under different conditions, aiding in better decision-making for investments, pricing, or cost strategies.

Flexibility and Adaptability: By exploring "what-if" scenarios, businesses can develop contingency plans and remain agile in adjusting to changes in the market or operating environment.
