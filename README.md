<h1>Project 1. Financial Modelling - Income Statement</h1>

1.	Forecasting the financial outlook 4 years in the future.

2.	Using upper and a lower case scenario.

Some reasons for forecasting?

- Forecasting an income statement helps businesses plan strategically by projecting future revenues, expenses, and profits, ensuring alignment with their financial goals. 

- It aids in budgeting and assessing the feasibility of key initiatives like expansions or product launches. Additionally, it supports cash flow management by identifying potential surpluses or deficits, allowing companies to allocate resources effectively and avoid liquidity issues. 

- Forecasting also informs strategic decisions, such as investments or cost optimization, based on expected financial outcomes. Moreover, it enhances communication with stakeholders like investors and lenders, demonstrating a clear financial outlook and building confidence. Lastly, it provides benchmarks for tracking progress and ensuring the organization stays on target to meet objectives.

<h1>Project 3. Financial Scenario & Sensitivity Analysis</h1>

1. Calculated the units we need to sell at the price to get to a $100k profit with 2 constraints, below a certain max price and unit volumes - using Solver.

2. Created a Sensitivity Analysis to stress test the profit at different unit prices points and volumes sold - using What If Analysis.

3. Conducted a Scenario Analysis - how are revenue and profit effected in different assumptions and scenarios.


Some of the key reasons for using sensitivity and scenario analysis in determining profit are:

- Risk Management: These analyses help businesses identify and evaluate the impact of key variables (e.g., sales, costs, market conditions) on profitability, enabling preparation for adverse outcomes.

- Strategic Decision-Making: They provide insights into the range of possible financial outcomes under different conditions, aiding in better decision-making for investments, pricing, or cost strategies.

- Flexibility and Adaptability: By exploring "what-if" scenarios, businesses can develop contingency plans and remain agile in adjusting to changes in the market or operating environment.

<h1>Project 4. Profit & Loss in a Pivot Table</h1>
<h3>(using dax, power query, power pivot and data modeling in excel) </h3>

1.	I built a Profit & Loss Statement inside a pivot table, allowing for the data to be sliced and diced by different catogories, ranges etc (fully automated pivot table)
2.	Feel free to download a copy (start of this page) to see the pivot table functionality and workings. If youd like to recreate it I've included the resource below.
