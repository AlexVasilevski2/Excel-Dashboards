<h1>Project 1. Profit & Loss in a Pivot Table</h1>
<h3>(using dax, power query, power pivot and data modeling in excel) </h3>

Built a Profit & Loss Statement inside a pivot table, to allow slicing by categories etc. 

Feel free to download a copy (above) to see full functonality of the pivot table.

If you'd like to recreate it I've included the resource below.

<h1>Project 4. Financial Scenario & Sensitivity Analysis</h1>

1. Using Solver in excel - calculated the units and price required to get to a $100k profit with added constraints or cielings on price and unit volumes.

2. Created a Sensitivity Analysis to stress test the profit at different unit prices points and volumes sold - using What If Analysis.

3. Conducted a Scenario Analysis - how are revenue and profit effected with different assumptions and scenarios.


Some of the key reasons for using sensitivity and scenario analysis in determining profit are:

- Risk Management: These analyses help businesses identify and evaluate the impact of key variables (e.g., sales, costs, market conditions) on profitability, enabling preparation for adverse outcomes.

- Strategic Decision-Making: They provide insights into the range of possible financial outcomes under different conditions, aiding in better decision-making for investments, pricing, or cost strategies.

- Flexibility and Adaptability: By exploring "what-if" scenarios, businesses can develop contingency plans and remain agile in adjusting to changes in the market or operating environment.
